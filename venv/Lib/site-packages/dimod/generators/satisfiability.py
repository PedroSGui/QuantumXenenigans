    kMC-SAT [#ZK]_ is an NP-complete problem class
    that consists in satisfying a number of
    clauses of ``k`` literals (variables, or their negations).
    Each clause should encode a max-cut problem over the clause literals.
    
    Each clause contributes -:code:`k//2` to the energy when the clause is 
    satisfied, and at least 0 when unsatisfied. The energy :math:`H(s)` for a 
    spin assignment :math:`s` is thus lower bounded by :math:`E_{SAT}=-`:code:`k//2 * num_clauses`, 
    this lower bound matches the ground state energy in satisfiable instances. 
    For k>3, energy penalties per clause violation are non-uniform.


    Args:
        num_variables: The number of variables in the problem.
        k: number of variables participating in the clause.
        num_clauses: The number of clauses. Each clause contains three literals.
        plant_solution: Create literals uniformly subject to the constraint that the
            all 1 (and all -1) are ground states (satisfy all clauses).

    Returns:
        A binary quadratic model with spin variables.

    .. note:: The clauses are randomly sampled from the space of k-variable
        clauses *with replacement* which can result in collisions. However,
        collisions are allowed in standard problem definitions, are absent with
        high probability in interesting cases, and are almost always harmless
        when they do occur.

        be achieved (in some special cases) without modification of the hardness
        qualities of the instance class. Planting of a not all 1 ground state
        can be achieved with a spin-reversal transform without loss of generality. [#DKR]_
